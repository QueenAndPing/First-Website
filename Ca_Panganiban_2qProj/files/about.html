      <p>History</p>
      <h1>The BMJ is one of the world's oldest general medical journals. It published its first weekly edition on 3 October 1840 as the Provincial Medical and Surgical Journal before uniting with the London Journal of Medicine and publishing from January 1853 as the Associated Medical Journal.  Four years later in January 1857, this merged journal became the British Medical Journal. The title was shortened to BMJ in 1988, and then changed to The BMJ in 2014.</h1>

      <p>History of Our Advocacy</p>
      <h1>This medical research advocacy group began in the early 2010s with a handful of volunteers dedicated to raising awareness of medical research and its potential to improve lives. We started by organizing fundraisers and conferences, encouraging people to get involved in medical research and to donate to medical research organizations. As our reach grew, we began lobbying local and state governments to increase funding for medical research initiatives and to increase public access to medical research findings. We also began to advocate for better patient safety standards in medical research and increased transparency in medical research studies. Over the years, we have become a powerful force in the medical research community, working with government officials, scientists, and medical researchers to push for greater access to medical research and better patient safety standards. We are also involved in launching innovative public outreach campaigns to raise awareness of the importance of medical research and its potential to help us all live healthier lives.</h1>
